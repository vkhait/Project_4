Project aim: to predict the risk of strokes based on different circumstances (i.e. age, employment, bmi etc.)

# Steps to be taken:

* Clean the dataset
* Build a machine learning model to perform predictions
* Test the machine learning model
* Create visualizations based on the dataset in Tableau
* Create presentation in Tableau


# The following will be used:

Python to clean the dataset
Python to create the machine learning model
Tableau to create visualizations and presentation


## Project Realisation


# Tableau:

We did some basic visualizations with Tableau to see what conclusions we could draw from the dataset. The main conclusions were: 

* Women suffer from stroke more than men, while men suffer from heart disease more than women. The main ages affected by both stroke and heart disease are 70+ for females. Men have an increasing risk of stroke from the age of 50, however the risk of heart disease is drastically increasing with each decade after the age of 50, reaching its peak at 70.
* Out of the whole dataset, only 4.87% of participants had a stroke.
* The highest number of strokes fell in the high BMI.
* Most susceptible to stroke work in a private sector
